# Patricia Trie and Prefix Trie Implementation

## Description
This project implements a Patricia Trie and includes the ability to:
- Insert, search, delete, and range-search keys.
- Visualize the trie structure at every step using Graphviz.
- Benchmark performance for operations across datasets of varying sizes.
- Display performance graphs for time complexity and memory usage.

## Features
- **Patricia Trie:** Efficient trie implementation with edge compression.
- **Visualization:** Interactive visualization of trie operations.
- **Performance Benchmarking:** Analyze insert, search, range-search, and delete operations.

## Requirements
Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. The project uses the following libraries:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `graphviz`
- `memory-profiler`
- `pypdf2`
